I. Shell-scripting

1. Define a variable with the string 'Hello World'
Print the value of the variable you've defined and redirect the output to the file "amazing_output.txt"

2. Write a script that will put the current date in a file called "the_date.txt"
[Solution](https://github.com/Antoshik143/21_ex_for_devops/blob/main/shell-scripts/scripts/2.sh)

3. Write a script that will print "Today is a great day!" unless it's given a day name and then it should print "Today is "

Note: no need to check whether the given argument is actually a valid day.

4. Write a script that when given a number, will:

Check if the number has 2 as factor, if yes it will print "one factor"
Check if the number has 3 as factor, if yes it will print "one factor...actually two!"
If none of them (2 and 3) is a factor, print the number itself.

5. Note: assume the script is executed with an argument

Write a script that will check if a given argument is the string "pizza"
If it's the string "pizza" print "with pineapple?"
If it's not the string "pizza" print "I want pizza!"
